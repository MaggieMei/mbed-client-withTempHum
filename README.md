# mbed-os-example-client-withTempHum

This is a simple example of mbed client with Grove Temperature&Humidity Sensor working for temperature&humidity detection in real time with mbed OS. You may need to take a look at [mbed-client-quickstart](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart) first to finish the device registration.

The application:

* Registers with mbed Device Connector.
* Gives mbed Device Connector access to its resources (read and write).
* Records the number of clicks on the deviceâ€™s button and temperature&humidity detected by the sensor](https://developer.mbed.org/components/Grove-TempHumi-Sensor/) and sends them to mbed Device Connector.

## Application resources

 Five [resources](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-device-connector-web-interfaces/en/latest/#the-mbed-device-connector-data-model) are included:

* `Button (3200/0/5501)`. Number of presses of SW2 (GET).
* `LED Blink (3201/0/5850)`.Blink function, blinks `LED1` when executed (POST)
* `Blink Patter (3201/0/5853)`. Used by the blink function to determine how to blink. In the format of `1000:500:1000:500:1000:500` (PUT).
* `PIR State (3300/0/5700)`. Pir state function, turn PIR sensor on or off by click the corresponding buttons (POST).
* `Motion Detection (3300/0/5701)`. Number of motion detected by PIR sensor (GET).

## Required hardware

* An [FRDM-K64F](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/frdm-k64f/) board with [PIR sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/PIR_Motion_sensor_module#Introduction).
* An Ethernet connection to the internet.
* An Ethernet cable.
* A micro-USB cable.

## Required software

* An [ARM mbed account](https://developer.mbed.org/account/login/?next=/).
* [yotta](http://docs.yottabuild.org/#installing) - to build the example programs. To learn how to build mbed OS applications with yotta, see [the user guide](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/getting-started-mbed-os/en/latest/Full_Guide/app_on_yotta/#building-an-application).
* A [serial port monitor](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC#host-interface-and-terminal-applications).

## Monitoring the application

The application prints debug messages over the serial port, so you can monitor its activity with a serial port monitor. The application uses baud rate 115200.

**Note:** Instructions to set this up are located [here](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC#host-interface-and-terminal-applications).

After the bin file downloaded and your board reset, you should see the messages as below:

```
In app_start()
IP address 10.164.3.62
Device name 1b0273c6-d31f-4337-8c5b-fbc8b1fff045

SOCKET_MODE : UDP
Connecting to coap://api.connector.mbed.com:5684

Registered object successfully!
```

**Note:** Device name is the endpoint name you will need later on [Testing the application](https://github.com/MaggieMei/mbed-client-withPIR#testing-the-application) chapter.

After you click the `SW2` button on your board you should see messages about the value changes:

```
handle_button_click, new value of counter is 1
```

When something moves in the detecting range of PIR sensor, the monitor will output the messages like this:

```
Hello! I've detected 1 times since reset
```

By experiments you will find the sensor is really sensitive.

## Testing the application

1. After device registration finished, go to [My devices > Connected devices](https://connector.mbed.com/#endpoints). Your device should be listed here.
2. Press the `SW2` button on the device a number of times (make a note of how many times you did that).
3. Go to [Device Connector > API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console).
4. Enter `https://api.connector.mbed.com/endpoints/DEVICE_NAME/3200/0/5501` in the URI field and click **TEST API**. Replace `DEVICE_NAME` with your actual endpoint name. The device name can be found in the `source/security.h` file, see variable `MBED_ENDPOINT_NAME` or it can be found from the traces [Monitoring the application](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart#monitoring-the-application).
5. The number of times you pressed `SW2` is shown.
6. Enter `https://api.connector.mbed.com/endpoints/DEVICE_NAME/3300/0/5700` in the URI field and click **TEST API**.
7. The number of motion detected by the sensor is shown.
8. Press the `SW3` button to unregister from mbed Device Connector. You should see `Unregistered Object Successfully` printed to the serial port and LED starts blinking. This will also stop your application. Press the `RESET` button to run the program again.

**NOTE:** If you get an error, for example `Server Response: 410 (Gone)`, clear your browser's cache, log out, and log back in. 
**NOTE:** Only GET methods can be executed through [Device Connector > API Console](https://connector.mbed.com/#console). For the other methods check the [mbed Device Connector Quick Start](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-connector-api-node-quickstart).
